      <h1>The Story Behind Gidan Dan Hausa</h1>
      <h4>
        Located in Kano State, Gidan Dan Hausa played an important role in the
        modernisation of northern Nigeria, but only a few know the history
        behind this beautiful building. Michael Oche reports from Kano. Gidan
        Dan Hausa is said to be more than 250 years old, and was originally
        owned by a local chief responsible for managing the Emir’s farmland. The
        name Gidan Dan Hausa literally means ‘The Son of Hausa residence” in
        Hausa, it became the birth place of western education in northern
        Nigeria. As Kano’s first colonial residency, it was here that the
        English language was first taught in the North of Nigeria by Hanns
        Vischer, a British Educational Officer who was its first British
        resident in 1908. He taught all the young princes of the Kano Emirate
        how to speak and write in English and was given the traditional title
        Dan Hausa, meaning ‘Son of Hausa.’ Available records show that the
        school, which started with 30 pupils in 1909, had a student population
        of 209 in 1913 with students drawn from the 11 Northern provinces.
        According to Historians, Vischer arrived in Nigeria in 1906 after
        travelling by caravan from Tripoli, Libya, and first stayed at the
        Emir’s Palace before moving to the house. His wife Isabella joined him
        in 1912. But the house was built more than 150 years before Vischer
        occupied and re-designed it and was used by the British until 1960.
        Despite its pivotal role in the history of Nigeria, many northerners
        know little or nothing about the building’s illustrious past. ] Its
        significance goes beyond its architectural design, which is one of its
        most interesting features and an outstanding example of Hausa mud-walled
        architecture. The fact that it still remains standing to this day shows
        how accomplished the architects of that era were. Rebuilt in 1901, Gidan
        Dan Hausa has managed to maintain much of its original and unique
        structure. It has since been converted into a museum adorned with
        pictures of Vischer, his wife and housemaid, and is also home to the
        Kano state History and Culture Bureau. Speaking to LEADERSHIP SUNDAY,
        the Executive Director of the Kano state History and Culture Bureau,
        Mallam Ali Abubakar Bature said “Hanns Vischer was an educational
        officer in the British army who was posted to Kano as an educational
        officer. He was the second man sent by the British; the first was Mr.
        Miller, who failed to win the trust of the people of Kano because he
        came with the missionary approach, in contrast to the Islamic culture of
        the people. Mr. Vichser was a bit smarter because he was able to combine
        Islamic and western education.” He went on to say that Mr Vichser
        “studied the culture of the people of Kano very well, he was even able
        to speak the Hausa Language. He mingled with the people and got the
        acceptance and confidence of the people to the extent that he was given
        that traditional title – Dan Hausa. He got married here in this house
        and his first and second children were born here. “You can say that Mr.
        Vischer laid the foundations for modern education in the north in Kano.
        It was through him – because he was able to translate Hausa into English
        – that Hausa was first translated into Latin.” Historian Malam Abdukadir
        Sule, told LEADERSHIP SUNDAY that “this is a historic building, but it
        is my belief that Nigeria, and indeed Kano state, has not really
        explored the potential that lie therein. Monuments such as this can
        attract tourists from across the world if well packaged.” He said that
        the inadequate attention given to the upgrading of infrastructure of
        important national heritage buildings is responsible for low returns
        from the tourism sector. “Most of us believe that museums were
        established for the purpose of education and learning, or research and
        conservation. However, as society has changed, the economic role of
        museums has become more important.
